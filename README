1) ./preconf
2) ./configure
   If full optimization is needed one can run ./configure --with-debug=no
3) cd project/
4) ./spe_prec
   One should have a file named spe_perm.dat in project/ directory with data:
   * wget http://www.spe.org/web/csp//datasets/por_perm_case2a.zip
   * unzip por_perm_case2a.zip
